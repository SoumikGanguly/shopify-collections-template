# shopify-collections-template
I scoured the Internet, downloaded apps, looked through blogs and couldn't really find a solution to adding more products to the collection page and add lazy loading to the products. But it simple change to the json data in the collection template. You can look through the code and see the comment I added in the file

The code generally appears in the main-collection-product-grid.liquid 

Errors: Setting 'products_per_page' can't be greater than 24
